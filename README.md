# WVFC - Paperwork Checkout System

This is a test system for handling checkout paperwork for the <a href="http://www.wvfc.org">WVFC.</a> 

=======

This code is written in python 2.7 and runs on Google App Engine. 

This system allows WVFC members to fill out their checkout forms which are then automatically emailed to the safety office and stored in a database. 

Each checkout form is a different template. This is done to ensure it is easy to update. (There are much better ways to make this extensible)
